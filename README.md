# OpenPNM

OpenPNM is an open-source API designed specifically for DOCSIS Proactive Network Maintenance (PNM) in cable broadband networks. It provides developers with hooks and functions to access and utilize PNM functionalities. Here's a summary of how OpenPNM supports PNM:

1. Purpose: OpenPNM aims to facilitate proactive network maintenance in cable broadband systems by offering an open-source API that allows developers to monitor, analyze, and address network issues.

2. Monitoring: OpenPNM provides functions and tools to monitor critical network parameters such as signal levels, noise, MER, packet loss, and other relevant metrics. Developers can leverage these features to continuously collect data from the cable network.

3. Analysis: The API offers algorithms and statistical models to analyze the collected network data. Developers can utilize these tools to detect deviations and anomalies in network behavior, enabling the identification of potential issues.

4. Issue Localization: OpenPNM assists developers in pinpointing the location of network impairments or faults. By analyzing data from various network elements, developers can narrow down the problematic segments or devices causing the issues.

5. Remediation: Once an issue is identified and localized, OpenPNM provides functions to initiate appropriate actions for resolution. Developers can adjust signal levels, optimize amplifier settings, replace faulty components, or schedule maintenance visits to affected areas using the API.

6. Preventive Maintenance: With OpenPNM, developers can proactively address network issues, preventing service disruptions and customer complaints. By utilizing the API's features, they can improve network reliability and minimize downtime.

7. Efficiency: OpenPNM reduces the need for reactive maintenance by enabling proactive network maintenance strategies. This helps service providers save costs and ensures a more stable and reliable internet connection, resulting in an enhanced customer experience.

In summary, OpenPNM is an open-source API that empowers developers to implement DOCSIS Proactive Network Maintenance. With its monitoring, analysis, issue localization, and remediation capabilities, OpenPNM facilitates proactive maintenance, leading to improved network performance and customer satisfaction.
